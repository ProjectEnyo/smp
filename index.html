					You are safe from PvP in the spawn area, but you may build there.
					Leaving it for the Wilderness means you can be killed by other players.
				</p>
				<p>
					You are responsible for your own builds when it comes to griefing.
					To avoid getting your base griefed, you can protect it by claiming the blocks around it.
					As a new player, you may create a small claim centered around you with <code>/claim</code>.
					Future claims requires a golden shovel.
					Remember that players can enter your claim if they have an open way inside.
